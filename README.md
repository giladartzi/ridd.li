Riddli is a trivia game, created for learning purposes. I truly believe that the best way to learn new technologies involve writing code and implementing a "real life" system. Online system can be found in https://ridd.li.

### Technologies
The technologies used for this project include:  `node`,  `mongoDB`, `webpack`, `babel`, `async` Functions,  `react`, `redux`, `react-router`, `material-ui` and more.

### The game
The rules are simple. When a user is logging into the system, he enters the "lounge", where the user can see all the other available players and challenge them to a dual of trivia. If an opponent accepts the user's invitation, the game begins and each player is presented a series of ten question, one by one. Each question is revealed in its turn, and when both users have answered, the game proceeds to the next question. For every correct answer, the user get a point, for every wrong one the user loses a point. An unanswered or timed-out question does not add neither subtract and points. At the end of the game, the user with most points, wins.
